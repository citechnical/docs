Write For CITechnical
---------------------

Many IT developers and specialists like to write. It's it our blood. Also, the information in the document library repository is being shared with the public in an effort to 1) maintain a library of technical documentation related to our business and 2) to provide a place for other technologists to find trusted documentation. These documents will be accurate prescriptions for doing things correctly and with quality. CITechnical considers education a lifestyle and while we are all learning new things we can share with others.

If you've decided that you would like to write for us and contribute to this quality technical library, we will hereafter refer to you here as "author". Your work will be attributed as such if it's reviewed and accepted for library inclusion.

Use the [style guide](docs/style-guide.md). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

-   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically accurate.
-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Library [style guide](docs/style-guide.md).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for CITechnical Inc. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

Want to make sure you don't waste time writing a long article we can't use? Submit a writing sample first, to <librarysubmissions@linode.com>.
