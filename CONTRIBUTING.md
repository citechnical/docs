Write For CITechnical
---------------------

Many IT developers and specialists like to write. It's in our blood. Also, the information in this document repository is being shared with the public in an effort to 1) maintain a quality library of technical documentation related to our business and 2) to provide a centralized location or one-stop shop for other technologists and entrepreneurs to obtain complete and trusted documentation. These documents will be concise but accurate prescriptions for doing things correctly and with quality. CITechnical considers education a lifestyle and while we take the time to learn new things we feel obligated to share with others. We are enlightened by anything new that we learn. And, most of us always want to share the news. 

If you've decided that you would like to write for us and contribute to our technical library, we will hereafter refer to you here as "author". And, your work will be attributed as such if it's reviewed and accepted for library inclusion.

Use the [style guide](docs/style-guide.md). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

-   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically accurate.
-   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the CITechnical Library [style guide](docs/style-guide.md).
-   Original. Your content should be original material written for CITechnical Inc. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources. The documentation found here should be representative of your experience. You may watch someone do IT work, but it's not easy describing something that you have not experienced for yourself, hence original texts. Please 

Want to make sure you don't waste time writing a long article we can't use? Submit a writing sample first, to <admin@citechnical.com>.
